# üß™ Testing Guide - Multi-User Video Fix

## Quick Test (3 Users)

### Setup
1. Make sure server is running:
   ```bash
   ./bin/xsami
   ```

2. Open **3 different browsers/windows**:
   - Chrome (normal)
   - Chrome (Incognito)
   - Firefox

## Step-by-Step Test

### Step 1: First User (Host)

## What to Look For

### ‚úÖ Success Indicators

**Visual:**
- [ ] All users see all other participants
- [ ] Videos are playing smoothly
- [ ] Audio is working (test by speaking)
- [ ] Grid adjusts automatically (2x1, 2x2, etc.)

**Browser Console (F12):**
```javascript
WebSocket connected
Creating peer connection for peer_xxx, initiator: true
Remote track received from peer_xxx : video
Remote track received from peer_xxx : audio
Video element created for peer peer_xxx
Connection state with peer_xxx: connected
ICE connection state with peer_xxx: connected
```

**Server Logs:**
```
Peer peer_abc123 joining room xyz
Track received from peer peer_abc123: xxx, Type: video
Track received from peer peer_abc123: yyy, Type: audio
Peer Connection State: connected
ICE Connection State: connected
```

## ‚ùå Troubleshooting

### Problem: Can't see other users

**Check 1: Browser Console**
```javascript
// Look for errors like:
Failed to set remote description
Error handling signaling message
Connection state: failed
```

**Check 2: Network Tab (F12 ‚Üí Network ‚Üí WS)**
- WebSocket connection should be active (green)
- Should see continuous messages

**Check 3: Permissions**
- Ensure camera/mic permissions granted
- Check browser address bar for blocked icons

### Problem: Only 2 users visible (old bug)

**Solution:**
1. Hard refresh all browsers: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
2. Clear browser cache
3. Restart server:
   ```bash
   pkill -f xsami
   ./bin/xsami &
   ```

### Problem: No audio/video

**Check:**
- Camera/mic not in use by another app
- Correct devices selected (click settings icon)
- Green indicators on mic/camera buttons

## Advanced Testing

### Test 4+ Users
1. Open 4-6 browser windows
2. Join same room
3. Verify grid layout changes:
   - 4 users ‚Üí 2√ó2 grid
   - 5-6 users ‚Üí 3√ó2 grid
   - 7-9 users ‚Üí 3√ó3 grid

### Test Screen Sharing
1. Join with 2+ users
2. User 1 clicks screen share button
3. **Expected:** All other users see User 1's screen

### Test Connection Stability
1. User 2 closes browser
2. **Expected:** User 1 and 3 see User 2's video disappear
3. Reconnect User 2
4. **Expected:** Everyone sees everyone again

### Test Chat
1. Open chat sidebar (click chat icon)
2. Send messages
3. **Expected:** All users receive messages in real-time

## Performance Check

### Browser Performance
Open Chrome Task Manager (Shift + Esc):
- **2 users**: ~200-300 MB RAM per tab
- **4 users**: ~400-500 MB RAM per tab
- **6 users**: ~600-800 MB RAM per tab

### Network Usage (Chrome DevTools ‚Üí Network)
- **Video**: ~1-2 Mbps upload per peer
- **Audio**: ~50-100 kbps upload per peer
- **Total for 4 users**: ~3-6 Mbps upload

## Comparison: Before vs After

### Before Fix ‚ùå
```
User A joins ‚Üí sees self ‚úì
User B joins ‚Üí sees self + User A ‚úì
User C joins ‚Üí sees ONLY self ‚ùå
User A sees ‚Üí self + User B (not User C) ‚ùå
```

### After Fix ‚úÖ
```
User A joins ‚Üí sees self ‚úì
User B joins ‚Üí sees self + User A ‚úì
User C joins ‚Üí sees self + User A + User B ‚úì
User A sees ‚Üí self + User B + User C ‚úì
User B sees ‚Üí self + User A + User C ‚úì
```
