# Screen Sharing Implementation - Complete Guide

## Overview
Implemented a modern, professional screen sharing feature that follows industry best practices (Zoom/Teams pattern). When a participant shares their screen, it displays prominently in the main viewing area with participant thumbnails in a horizontal strip below.

## 🎯 Features Implemented

### 1. Screen Share Handler Enhancements
**File:** `src/app/room/[id]/page.tsx` (lines ~212-269)

**Features:**
- ✅ Start/Stop screen sharing functionality
- ✅ Automatic track replacement for all peer connections
- ✅ WebSocket notifications to all participants
- ✅ Auto-switch back to camera when screen sharing ends
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- ✅ Emoji-based logging for debugging (📺 🛑 📤 ❌)

**WebSocket Events Sent:**
```typescript
// When starting screen share
{
  event: 'screen-share-start',
  data: { 
    peerId: myPeerId,
    username: myUsername,
  }
}

// When stopping screen share
{
  event: 'screen-share-stop',
  data: { peerId: myPeerId }
}
```

### 2. Conditional Layout System
**File:** `src/app/room/[id]/page.tsx` (lines ~420-535)

**Two Layouts:**

#### A. Screen Sharing Active Layout
When `activeSharingPeerId` is set:

**Main View:**
- Full-screen presenter video with dark background
- Professional blue badge showing who is presenting
- Maximized screen share for optimal visibility
- Smooth transitions and modern styling

**Thumbnail Strip:**
- Horizontal scrollable strip at the bottom
- 160px × 112px thumbnails (16:9 aspect ratio)
- Excludes the presenting participant (no duplicate)
- Hover effects with primary color border
- Smooth scrolling with custom scrollbar styling

#### B. Normal Grid Layout
When no one is sharing (`activeSharingPeerId === null`):
- Standard responsive grid layout
- 1-4 columns based on screen size
- Equal-sized video tiles
- All participants visible including local user

### 3. WebSocket Integration
**File:** `src/hooks/useWebRTCSignaling.ts` (lines 377-385)

**Event Handlers:**
```typescript
case 'screen-share-start': {
  setActiveSharingPeer(message.data.peerId);
  break;
}

case 'screen-share-stop': {
  setActiveSharingPeer(null);
  break;
}
```

**Store Actions Used:**
- `setActiveSharingPeer(peerId | null)` - Updates active presenter

### 4. Visual Indicators

#### Presenter Badge
- Blue badge with monitor icon
- Shows "You are presenting" for local user
- Shows "[Username] is presenting" for remote users
- Positioned at top-left of screen share view
- Semi-transparent backdrop with blur effect

#### Stop Sharing Button
- Visible when user is actively sharing
- Red monitor icon changes to stop icon
- Immediate feedback on click

## 🎨 UX/UI Best Practices

### 1. Modern Design Patterns
- **Zoom/Teams Pattern**: Large screen share + participant thumbnails
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Shared content takes priority
- **Context Preservation**: Thumbnails keep participants visible
- **Professional Styling**: Smooth animations, shadows, borders

### 2. Responsive Design
- **Desktop**: Full-featured layout with large screen share
- **Tablet**: Smaller thumbnails, scrollable strip
- **Mobile**: Automatically adapts grid/thumbnail sizes

### 3. Accessibility
- Clear visual indicators of who is presenting
- High contrast badges for readability
- Keyboard navigation support (scrollable thumbnail strip)
- Screen reader friendly labels

### 4. Performance Optimizations
- Conditional rendering (only one layout active at a time)
- Efficient filtering of participants
- No unnecessary re-renders
- Proper cleanup of media tracks

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### State Management
**Store:** `src/store/room.store.ts`

```typescript
// State
activeSharingPeerId: string | null

// Action
setActiveSharingPeer: (peerId: string | null) => void
```

### Media Track Handling
```typescript
// Replace video track with screen share
const videoSender = connection.getSenders()
  .find(s => s.track?.kind === 'video');
if (videoSender && screenTrack) {
  await videoSender.replaceTrack(screenTrack);
}
```

### Automatic Cleanup
```typescript
// Detect when user stops sharing via browser UI
screenStream.getVideoTracks()[0].onended = async () => {
  toggleScreenShare();
  // Notify other participants
  webSocketService.send({
    event: 'screen-share-stop',
    data: { peerId: myPeerId },
  });
  // Switch back to camera
  // ...
};
```

## 📋 User Flow

### Starting Screen Share
1. User clicks "Share Screen" button (monitor icon)
2. Browser shows screen picker dialog
3. User selects screen/window/tab to share
4. System:
   - Captures screen media stream
   - Replaces video tracks in all peer connections
   - Sends `screen-share-start` WebSocket event
   - Updates UI to large screen share view
5. All participants see:
   - Large screen share in main area
   - Blue badge indicating presenter
   - Thumbnails of all other participants below

### During Screen Share
- Presenter sees "You are presenting" badge
- Other participants see "[Name] is presenting" badge
- Video continues to be transmitted to all peers
- Audio still works normally
- Other controls remain accessible

### Stopping Screen Share
1. User clicks "Stop Sharing" button OR closes share via browser
2. System:
   - Stops screen stream
   - Switches back to camera
   - Sends `screen-share-stop` WebSocket event
   - Returns to normal grid layout
3. All participants return to standard grid view

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Basic Functionality
- [ ] Can start screen sharing
- [ ] Can stop screen sharing via button
- [ ] Can stop screen sharing via browser UI
- [ ] Screen share visible to all participants
- [ ] Automatic switch back to camera works

### Multi-Participant Scenarios
- [ ] Multiple participants can see shared screen
- [ ] Layout changes for all when sharing starts
- [ ] Layout reverts for all when sharing stops
- [ ] Only one person can share at a time (handled by UI button state)
- [ ] Late joiners see active screen share

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Screen share works with 2 participants
- [ ] Screen share works with 10+ participants
- [ ] Network interruption during screen share
- [ ] Refreshing page while someone is sharing
- [ ] Presenter leaves room while sharing

### Visual/UX
- [ ] Badge shows correct presenter name
- [ ] Thumbnail strip scrolls smoothly
- [ ] Presenter not shown twice (main view + thumbnail)
- [ ] Transitions are smooth
- [ ] Hover effects work on thumbnails

## 🚀 Backend Requirements

The backend needs to relay these WebSocket events:

```go
// In your WebSocket message handler
case "screen-share-start":
    // Broadcast to all other participants in room
    broadcastToRoom(roomID, message, excludePeerID)

case "screen-share-stop":
    // Broadcast to all other participants in room
    broadcastToRoom(roomID, message, excludePeerID)
```

**Note:** The backend should be simple relay - no state management needed. The frontend handles all screen sharing logic.

## 📊 Architecture Decisions

### Why Peer-to-Peer?
- Low latency for screen sharing
- No server processing overhead
- Better quality (no transcoding)
- Scales well for small-medium meetings

### Why Conditional Layout?
- Best UX practice (industry standard)
- Focuses attention on shared content
- Maintains context with participant thumbnails
- Clean visual hierarchy

### Why WebSocket Notifications?
- Real-time state sync across all participants
- Reliable delivery
- Low overhead
- Already integrated in existing architecture

## 🔍 Debugging

### Enable Verbose Logging
Screen sharing already includes emoji-based logs:
- 📺 Starting screen share
- 🛑 Stopping screen share
- 📤 Replacing video track for peer
- ❌ Error sharing screen

### Check Browser Console
```javascript
// Look for these logs
"📺 Starting screen share"
"📤 Replacing video track for peer: [username]"
"📺 Screen share ended (user stopped sharing)"
```

### Verify WebSocket Events
```javascript
// In browser console, monitor WebSocket
// Events should show:
{ event: 'screen-share-start', data: { peerId: '...', username: '...' } }
{ event: 'screen-share-stop', data: { peerId: '...' } }
```

### Common Issues

**Screen share not visible:**
- Check browser permissions
- Verify WebRTC track replacement
- Check console for errors
- Verify backend is relaying events

**Layout not switching:**
- Check `activeSharingPeerId` in store
- Verify WebSocket event received
- Check useWebRTCSignaling hook

**Tracks not switching:**
- Verify getDisplayMedia() success
- Check replaceTrack() calls
- Monitor peer connection state
