## 🎨 Design System Consistency

All new components follow the existing design patterns:

- **Colors:** Primary blue, danger red, warning yellow
- **Spacing:** Tailwind utility classes
- **Borders:** `border-border` with hover states
- **Buttons:** Using existing `Button` component
- **Icons:** Lucide React icons

---

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Dependencies Used
- **Zustand** - State management
- **Lucide React** - Icons
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling
- **TypeScript** - Type safety

### Performance Considerations
- Timer uses `setInterval` with cleanup
- Maps used for O(1) lookups
- Lazy rendering (components only mount when needed)
- No unnecessary re-renders

### Accessibility
- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA labels on buttons
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly

---

## �� Code Quality

- ✅ **No TypeScript errors**
- ✅ **No ESLint warnings**
- ✅ **Consistent code style**
- ✅ **Proper type annotations**
- ✅ **Clean component structure**
- ✅ **Reusable patterns**

---

## 🎓 Next Steps

### Immediate:
1. Test all features end-to-end
2. Verify WebSocket event handling
3. Test on mobile/tablet screens
4. Add backend handlers for new events (if not exists)

### Future Enhancements:
1. **File Attachments** in chat
2. **Annotation Toolbar** for screen sharing
3. **Poll System** for quick surveys
4. **Q&A Panel** for organized questions
5. **Breakout Rooms** for group discussions
6. **Reactions** animation improvements
