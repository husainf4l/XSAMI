- **Host has full control** over screen sharing permissions
- **Participants must request permission** to share their screen
- **Host can approve or deny** screen sharing requests
- **Host can revoke** screen sharing at any time

---

## Features Implemented

### 🎯 Host Privileges

✅ **Automatic Host Assignment**
- First person to join the room = Host
- Host status displayed with 👑 badge
- Host role persists until they leave

- Only host (or approved users) can share screen
- Host sees all screen share requests

✅ **Permission Management**
- Approve screen share requests
- Deny screen share requests  
- Revoke active screen shares

### 👥 Participant Experience

✅ **Screen Share Requests**
- Click screen share button → Request sent to host
- Wait for host approval

---

## How It Works

### 1. **Host Assignment**

```
User A joins room (first)
└─→ Server assigns Host role
    └─→ User A sees "👑 Host" badge
    └─→ User A can share screen immediately
```

### 2. **Participant Joins**

```
User B joins room
└─→ Server assigns Participant role
    └─→ User B sees Host is User A
    └─→ User B must request to share screen
```

### 3. **Screen Share Request Flow**

```
Participant clicks "Share Screen"
├─→ Checks permission (canShareScreen)
│   └─→ If NO permission:
│       └─→ Shows confirmation dialog
│           └─→ Sends request to host
│
Host receives request notification
├─→ Shows dialog: "User B requesting screen share. Allow?"
│   ├─→ Click "OK" → Approve
│   │   └─→ Server grants permission
│   │       └─→ Participant notified "Screen sharing approved!"
│   │           └─→ Participant can now share
│   │
│   └─→ Click "Cancel" → Deny
│       └─→ Server denies request
│           └─→ Participant notified "Request denied"
│
```

## Testing Guide

### Test 1: Host Screen Sharing (Immediate)

1. **Open first browser** (Chrome)
   ```
   http://localhost:8080/room/create
   ```

2. **Check for host badge** - You should see "👑 Host" on your video

3. **Click "Share Screen"** - Should work immediately without requesting

4. **Select window/screen** - Your screen appears to all participants

✅ **Expected**: Host can share screen instantly

---

### Test 2: Participant Request Screen Share

1. **Keep first browser open** (Host)

2. **Open second browser** (Firefox/Incognito)
   ```
   Paste the same room URL
   ```

3. **On second browser (Participant)**:
   - Click "Share Screen" button
   - See dialog: "You need permission. Request?"
   - Click "OK"

4. **On first browser (Host)**:
   - See dialog: "Participant requesting screen share. Allow?"
   - Click "OK" to approve

5. **On second browser (Participant)**:
   - See alert: "Screen sharing approved!"
   - Click "Share Screen" again
   - Select window/screen
   - Screen appears to all participants

✅ **Expected**: Participant must request, host approves, then participant can share

---

### Test 3: Host Denies Request

1. **Third browser joins** (Edge/another Incognito)

2. **Third browser (Participant 2)**:
   - Click "Share Screen"
   - Request permission

3. **First browser (Host)**:
   - See request dialog
   - Click "Cancel" to deny

4. **Third browser (Participant 2)**:
   - See alert: "Screen sharing request denied."

## Backend Implementation

### Room Structure
```go
type Room struct {
    Peers            *Peers
    Hub              *chat.Hub
    HostPeerID       string            // First joiner
    ScreenSharePerms map[string]bool   // Permissions map
    PermLock         sync.RWMutex      // Thread-safe access
}
```

### Key Methods

### Issue: "Screen share works without permission"
**Solution**: You are the host! Hosts don't need permission.

### Issue: "Request not received by host"
**Solution**: 
- Check WebSocket connection
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify host is still in the room

### Issue: "Cannot share after approval"
**Solution**:
- Try clicking "Share Screen" again
- Check browser permissions for screen capture
- Refresh and try again

## Browser Console Commands

### Check Your Role
```javascript
console.log('My Peer ID:', myPeerId);
console.log('Am I Host?', isHost);
console.log('Host ID:', hostId);
console.log('Can Share Screen?', canShareScreen);
```

### Debug Permissions
```javascript
// Check peer connections
console.log('Connected Peers:', Object.keys(peerConnections));

// Check screen sharing state
console.log('Is Sharing:', isScreenSharing);
```
