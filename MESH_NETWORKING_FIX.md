# 🔧 Mesh Networking Fix - Multi-User Video Conferencing

## Problem Identified

**Issue**: Users could only see themselves and one other participant. The third, fourth, etc. participants were not visible.

**Root Cause**: The application was using a **single peer connection per client** architecture, which only works for 1-to-1 connections. WebRTC peer connections are inherently **one-to-one**, so for multi-user conferences, you need **one peer connection for each pair of users**.

### Previous Architecture (Broken)
```
Client A ←→ Server ←→ Client B
                ↑
                └──→ Client C (couldn't see others!)
```

### New Architecture (Fixed - Mesh Topology)
```
Client A ←→ Client B
    ↕         ↕
Client C ←→ Client D
```

Each client maintains **direct peer connections** with every other client.

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend (assets/js/room.js)

#### Changed from Single Peer Connection to Multiple
**Before:**
```javascript
let peerConnection = null;  // Single connection
```

**After:**
```javascript
let peerConnections = {};   // Map of connections by peer ID
let myPeerId = null;        // Unique ID for this client
```

#### New Peer Management System

**Peer Discovery:**
- When joining, server sends list of existing peers
- Client creates peer connections to all existing peers (as initiator)
- For new peers joining after you, wait for their offer (as receiver)

**Signaling Protocol:**
```javascript
// Server notifies about existing peers
{ event: 'peers', data: { peers: ['peer1', 'peer2'] } }

// Server notifies when new peer joins
{ event: 'peer-joined', data: { peerId: 'peer3' } }

// Server notifies when peer leaves
{ event: 'peer-left', data: { peerId: 'peer2' } }

// Clients exchange offers/answers/candidates
{ 
  event: 'offer', 
  data: { 
    peerId: 'sender_id',
    targetPeerId: 'receiver_id',
    sdp: '...' 
  } 
}
```

#### Track Handling
**Before:**
```javascript
peerConnection.ontrack = (event) => {
    handleRemoteTrack(event);  // No peer identification
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
pc.ontrack = (event) => {
    handleRemoteTrack(event, peerId);  // Track which peer
}
```

Each remote video is now identified by peer ID, so you see all participants.

---

### 2. Backend (internal/handler/room.go)

#### Peer ID Assignment
**New:** Server generates a unique UUID for each WebSocket connection:
```go
peerID := uuid.New().String()
```

#### Peer Discovery on Join
When a new peer joins:
1. Server sends them the list of existing peers
2. Server notifies all existing peers about the new joiner

```go
// Send existing peers to new joiner
peersMsg := map[string]interface{}{
    "event": "peers",
    "data": map[string]interface{}{
        "peers": existingPeers,
    },
}
c.WriteJSON(peersMsg)

// Notify existing peers about new joiner
joinMsg := map[string]interface{}{
    "event": "peer-joined",
    "data": map[string]interface{}{
        "peerId": peerID,
    },
}
room.Peers.BroadcastToOthers(joinMsg, peerID)
```

#### Message Routing
The server now routes signaling messages directly between specific peers:

```go
if targetPeerID, hasTarget := data["targetPeerId"].(string); hasTarget {
    data["peerId"] = peerID // Add sender ID
    delete(data, "targetPeerId") 
    
    forwardMsg := map[string]interface{}{
        "event": event,
        "data":  data,
    }
    
    room.Peers.SendToPeer(forwardMsg, targetPeerID)
}
```

---

### 3. Peer Management (pkg/webrtc/peers.go)

#### New Methods

**`AddPeerConnectionWithID`**
```go
func (p *Peers) AddPeerConnectionWithID(
    peerConnection *webrtc.PeerConnection, 
    ws *websocket.Conn, 
    peerID string,
) {
    // Store peer with unique ID
}
```

**`BroadcastToOthers`**
```go
func (p *Peers) BroadcastToOthers(message interface{}, excludePeerID string) {
    // Send to all except one peer
}
```

**`SendToPeer`**
```go
func (p *Peers) SendToPeer(message interface{}, peerID string) {
    // Send to specific peer
}
```

#### Updated PeerConnectionState
```go
type PeerConnectionState struct {
    PeerConnection *webrtc.PeerConnection
    Websocket      *ThreadSafeWriter
    PeerID         string  // NEW: Unique identifier
}
```

---

## How It Works Now

### Connection Flow

```
1. User A joins room
   → Server assigns ID: peer_abc123
   → Server sends: { event: 'peers', data: { peers: [] } }
   → User A sees empty room ✓

2. User B joins room
   → Server assigns ID: peer_def456
   → Server sends to B: { event: 'peers', data: { peers: ['peer_abc123'] } }
   → Server sends to A: { event: 'peer-joined', data: { peerId: 'peer_def456' } }
   → User B creates peer connection to A (initiator)
   → User B sends offer to A
   → User A receives offer, sends answer
   → User A ←→ User B connected ✓

3. User C joins room
   → Server assigns ID: peer_ghi789
   → Server sends to C: { event: 'peers', data: { peers: ['peer_abc123', 'peer_def456'] } }
   → Server sends to A & B: { event: 'peer-joined', data: { peerId: 'peer_ghi789' } }
   → User C creates connections to both A and B
   → User A ←→ User C connected ✓
   → User B ←→ User C connected ✓
   → All three users see each other! ✓
```

### Video Track Handling

When User A's camera track arrives:
```javascript
// On User B's side
pc.ontrack = (event) => {
    // event.streams[0] = User A's MediaStream
    // peerId = 'peer_abc123'
    
    // Create video element with ID: video-peer_abc123
    const video = document.createElement('video');
    video.srcObject = event.streams[0];
    videoGrid.appendChild(video);
}
```

Now each user's video has a unique container, so all participants are visible!

## Topology Comparison

### Before (SFU with Single Connection - BROKEN for Mesh)
```
         Server
           |
    +------+------+
    |      |      |
  User A User B User C
  
Only 1 peer connection per user → Only 2 users visible
```

### After (Full Mesh - WORKING)
```
User A ←→ User B
  ↕        ↕
User C ←→ User D

Each user has N-1 peer connections (N = total users)
```

---

## Scalability Considerations

### Current Mesh Topology
- **Pros**: 
  - Direct connections (low latency)
  - No server bandwidth cost for media
  - Simple implementation
  
- **Cons**: 
  - Bandwidth scales with N² (N users)
  - Client CPU/bandwidth intensive
  - Practical limit: ~6-10 users

### For Larger Groups (Future Enhancement)
Consider SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit) where server relays streams:
```
Client A → Server → Client B
          ↓
        Client C
```
This scales better to 20-100+ users but requires server-side media processing.

## Testing

### Test with 3+ Users

1. Open room in **3 different browsers** (or incognito windows):
   ```
   http://localhost:8080/room/create
   ```

2. Copy the room URL from first browser

3. Paste URL in second and third browsers

4. **Expected Result:**
   - All 3 users see their own video (local)
   - All 3 users see the other 2 users' videos (remote)
   - Total: 3 video tiles visible to each participant

5. **Check Console Logs:**
   ```javascript
   Creating peer connection for peer_xxx, initiator: true
   Remote track received from peer_xxx : video
   Video element created for peer peer_xxx
   ```

---

## Browser Console Debugging

### Good Signs
```
WebSocket connected
Peer peer_abc123 joining room xyz
Creating peer connection for peer_def456, initiator: true
Remote track received from peer_def456 : video
Remote track received from peer_def456 : audio
Video element created for peer peer_def456
Connection state with peer_def456: connected
```

### Warning Signs
```
Error handling signaling message
Failed to add ICE candidate
Connection state: failed
```

If you see warnings:
1. Check STUN server connectivity
2. Verify firewall isn't blocking WebRTC
3. Check browser console for detailed errors

---

## Screen Sharing Update

Screen sharing now replaces the video track in **all peer connections**:

```javascript
// Replace track for all peers
Object.values(peerConnections).forEach(pc => {
    const sender = pc.getSenders().find(s => 
        s.track && s.track.kind === 'video'
    );
    if (sender) {
        sender.replaceTrack(screenTrack);
    }
});
```

All participants will see your screen!
